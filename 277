Bandpass Modulation

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) , Phase Shift Keying (PSK) , Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

• the reverse of the modulation process
• Coherent demodulation
  - The receiver exploits knowledge of the carrier’s phase to detect the signals
  - Optimal method
• Noncoherent demodulation
  - The receiver does not utilize phase reference information
  - Phase estimation is not required
  - Suboptimal method
  
• Linear Modulation
  - ASK, PSK, QAM
  - Non-orthogonal modulation
  - Baseband signal (M-ary PAM signal) ´ Carrier
  - Bandwidth efficient
  - high data rate transmission
  - High cost
  - Large PAPR(peak-to-average power ratio)
  
• Constant Envelope Modulation
  - FSK
  - Orthogonal modulation
  - Power efficient
  - Low cost
  

• Peak-to-Average Power Ratio
  - PAPR = Peak Power / Average Power

• Large PAPR (peak-to-average power ratio)
   Requires a large dynamic range of DAC and ADC
    - Inefficient, quantization noise
    - large precision is required
    - meaning a large number of bits (cost)
    
   Requires inefficient (large) power back-off
    - May result in a high out-of-band harmonic distortion power, unless the transmitter's power amplifier exhibits an 
      extremely high linearity across the entire signal dynamic range
    - This potentially contaminates the adjacent channels with adjacent channel interference
